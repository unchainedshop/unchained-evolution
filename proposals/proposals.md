## New Feature Request

Fork this repository, copy the [SE-0000 Template](0000-proposal-template.md) give it a random number and name and describe the feature in detail.
Once you have a first draft send us a pull request. If we consider that the feature might be relevant for the product, we will
- Adjust the filename and SE number in your fork
- Merge it with our repository without closing the pull request
- List the feature request here in this file


That way you can now continue working on spec until it eventually finds it's way into our product roadmap and get's implemented.
