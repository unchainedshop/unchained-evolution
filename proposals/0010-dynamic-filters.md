# Dynamic Filters

* Proposal: [SE-0010](0010-dynamic-filters.md)
* Authors: @pozylon
* Status: **Implemented**
* Breaking: Yes

## Introduction

Custom filters for product and assortment lists so empower shops to render fancy filter UI's.

## Motivation

In a situation where a shop has tousands of products, simple category drilldown is not enough to easily find products.
In that case products and sub-assortments need to get filtered by certain attributes.

## Proposed solution

As filters can look exxtremely different, unchained should integrate a very basic but flexible system and allow developers to configure
filter behavior through plugins.

## Detailed design
