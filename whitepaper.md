*unchained.shop 2018*

Authors: P. Kaufmann, V. Rudelj

## tl;dr

This concept describes the current issues that decentralized blockchain-based systems have regarding the user experience people expect from a modern software. It further describes how a client-server web application (unchained.shop) could boost the usage of blockchain-technology by using micro-architecture & headless technologies.

## Vision

We are going to build the next generation ecommerce experience through a platform that is compatible with any kind of internet devices and decentralized systems, bridging ecommerce with the internet of things and distributed ledgers.

##Â Problem

If you want to sell products online today, you are forced to either build a shop that suits your needs, use a theme on a feature-restricted service like Shopify or use century old platforms like Magento or WooCommerce. We don't want to change that but provide a better alternative.

The hackernoon article Why Magento is still an E-Commerce giant in 2017 lays out how important Open-Source for global domination and enterprise usage is. And the developers of these platforms constantly try to incorporate new technologies like HTML5, therefore it is still possible to build a responsive shop with those tools. But there are massive shortcomings when it comes to supporting platforms like Smartphones, Smart TVs, Cars, Smartwatches.
All these ecommerce platforms are developed to run in your browser.
