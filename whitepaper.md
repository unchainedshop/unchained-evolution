##Â Problem

Lets assume you want to sell products online today. You are forced to either build a shop that suits your needs, use a theme on a feature-restricted service like Shopify or use century old platforms like Magento or WooCommerce.

The hackernoon article Why Magento is still a digital commerce giant in 2017 lays out how important Open-Source for global domination and enterprise usage is.

But there are massive shortcomings when it comes to supporting platforms like Smartphones, Smart TVs, Cars, Smartwatches.
All these ecommerce platforms are developed to run in your browser.
