# Headless E-Commerce Platform: Economic model
*unchained.shop 2018*

Authors: P. Kaufmann, V. Rudelj

## Key Factors

Unchained.shop will become the Magento of the IOT.

**Open Source**

Development agencies and enterprises that create and maintain software drop [proprietary software out of their landscapes](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/open-source-won-now/).

Most of the time, this is because of the following killer argument:
Users of OSS prevent vendor lock-in. Using software that is open to the public leads to communities that help each other, the software is resilient to economic issues like bankruptcy of the software owner.

Therefore, opening up the source code of unchained is not a goodwill, it's a key factor to gain market share on the backs of already established e-commerce platforms.

**Headless & Hackable**

Building an enterprise storefront includes evaluating e-commerce platforms to find out what the different platforms can deliver. Non-hackable software (like SaaS) use the technique of "customizing", meaning they provide a massive control panel where every aspect of the software can be configured, themed or disabled. Sadly there is always something that needs some extra development work and people need to hire somebody to create a plugin.

Unchained is not trying to create an online shop which can be configured by a non-developer, the software flow is changed through code and not through UI. This means a software developer is always required to configure the platform. It's called "hackable" software and allows to configure even parts of the software that were not intended to get configured by the core developers.

Connecting the two factors hackable & headless means:
- Possibility to integrate the platform with any kind of device popping up that has internet connection
- Possibility to configure the platform in any way possible
- Possibility to connect the platform with any kind of core system through network connectivity
