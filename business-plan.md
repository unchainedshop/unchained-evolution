# Company

## History

Under the name fivelines, Pascal and Vedran have been asked to build a combined B2C/B2B online-shop for a startup called Avantyard early 2017. The guys of Avantyard just finished their very successful crowdfunding campaign for a new smell-free thrash bin: Freezyboy.

At fivelines we believe in cutting edge web app technology and when we started to evaluate existing shop platforms and tried to match the feature-sets with our requirements. After a while we found out that actually only one open-source digital commerce platform could suit as a base for the freezyboy shop at that time: Magento.

We had a look at the technology stack and then decided to build our own shop platform. A platform which is designed for the future.

That was the hour of birth of the unchained.shop platform.

[fivelines][1] is a joint-venture of Reactive Code GmbH and Fliptation GmbH.

##  Team

Bootstrapped by 2 Freelancers:

- **Pascal Kaufmann**, 30, Software Engineer & Operations, Founder of Reactive Code GmbH
- **Vedran Rudelj**, 38, Interaction Designer & Finances, Founder of Fliptation GmbH

That power team has almost everything which is needed to build the company.

- Vedran has 10 years of web design and interaction design experience, already built a shop platform for B2C: https://www.kickshops.ch (like Shopify) and knows how to calculate as a former funds manager at Credit Suisse.
- Pascal has 10 years of sofware development experience in web & native apps, lead a team at Swisscom and was once a SAP consultant and network engineer.

Both of them studied business administration and work for their own companies since many years.

We are still looking for somebody to relieve us with the PR, Sales & Social Media parts.

## Vision

Building the next-generation digital commerce experience for today's web agencies.

## Situation

To build the current software stacks we have already invested tons of non-billable hours. All investments flow into a [Slicing Pie][2] equity splitting model.

Costs (CHF 160'000)
- CHF 5'000 Hard Money
- CHF 155'000 (over 1'500 hours of work, CHF 100/h)

Revenue (CHF 30'000)
- GoLive of first customer project via our consulting label "fivelines": Freezyboy Online Shop

# Products & Services

## Platform

Unchained.shop is an open-source omni-channel digital commerce platform for the IOT.

**Open Source**

Development agencies and enterprises that create and maintain software drop [proprietary software out of their landscapes][3].

Most of the time, this is because of the following killer argument:
Users of OSS prevent vendor lock-in. Using software that is open to the public leads to communities that help each other, the software is resilient to economic issues like bankruptcy of the software owner.

Therefore, opening up the source code of unchained is not a goodwill, it's a key factor to gain market share on the backs of already established digital commerce platforms.

**Headless & Hackable**

Building an enterprise storefront includes evaluating digital commerce platforms to find out what the different platforms can deliver. Non-hackable software (like SaaS) use the technique of "customizing", meaning they provide a massive control panel where every aspect of the software can be configured, themed or disabled. Sadly there is always something that needs some extra development work and people need to hire somebody to create a plugin.

Unchained is not trying to create an online shop which can be configured by a non-developer, the software flow is changed through code and not through UI. This means a software developer is always required to configure the platform. It's called "hackable" software and allows to configure even parts of the software that were not intended to get configured by the core developers.

**USP**

Connecting the two factors hackable & headless means:
- Possibility to integrate the platform with any kind of device popping up that has internet connection
- Possibility to configure the platform in any way possible
- Possibility to connect the platform with any kind of core system through network connectivity

Unchained is the most flexible and future-proof digital commerce platform on the market.


## Service Portfolio

To fully concentrate on the product development, unchained will not build storefronts and websites for sellers. We are going to build SaaS services to complement and fund the development of our open source software.

#  Market & Competition

Valuable blog around e-commerce in general: https://www.twispay.com/blog

##  Digital Commerce Platform Market (business model)

Magento and WooCommerce together is about 35% of the global digital commerce platform market.
Based on the 10K web store statistics from https://blog.aheadworks.com/ecommerce-market-2017/ (September 2017):

**OSS Business Model** Market share **10K 44%**, **100K 55%**
- Magento (PHP)
- Prestashop (PHP)
- Shopware (PHP)
- ReactionComerce (Node)
- [OSCommerce][4] (PHP)
- [Opencart][5] (PHP)
- [Sylius][6] (PHP)

**Proprietary Software Licensing** Market share **10K 39%**, **100K 7%**
- Spryker (PHP)
- SAP Hybris (Custom)
- Oracle ATG
- IBM Websphere
- Salesforce Demandware

**SaaS** Market share **10K 17%**, **100K 38%**
- Shopify
- WixStores
- [Snipcart][7]
- [Foxy.io][8]

What is our conclusion?
1. Small Shops don't use proprietary licsensed digital commerce systems (uneconomical to do so because of high license fees and setup costs)
2. Big Shops don't use SaaS (price is not an issue, feature requirements can't be met, integration barriers are too high)
3. OSS platforms rule the mid- to enterprise sectors and [grow faster][9] than [proprietary platforms][10]. [even in the enterprise sector][11]

## Digital Commerce Platform Market (software architecture)

## USP

Open Source is growing rapidly in the enterprise market and at the same time, headless platforms and headless-enabling technologies like GraphQL start to show the true potential.

But there are currently no headless digital commerce platforms which are open source at the same time. Unchained will fit into that spot by combining a state of the art exxtremely flexible headless API based on GraphiQL and a true Open Source business model.

## Customer Segment

Small e-commerce shops today have a variety of options to sell their products easily through SaaS providers like Shopify.

Unchained.shop will not compete in that area and is developed for and suits the requirements of enterprise grade digital commerce with more than USD 20’000 of revenue per month.
