## Development major version: unchained 1.0

**Release Date**

Expected: Q3 2018. After the release date we plan to release new stable versions of unchained on a monthly rhythm and canary releases weekly.

**Licensing**

The unchained engine 1.0 will be released under the aGPLv3 license. But if we hit the hard-cap, we will release the unchained engine 1.0 and the unchained control panel under the very permissive MIT license terms.

### Primary quest: Open Source Readyness

The first version which will be publicly available. To do this we will have to unchain some major components from the reference implementation and move code which is customer-specific out of the base branch.

The following tasks are currently blocking the first OSS version of our product:

- [ ] 3 Agencies as partners
- [ ] Funding for the next few months of product development (either through ICO, bootstrapping or private equity)
- [ ] [SE-0001: Untangle](proposals/0001-open-source.md)

## Side quests

Beyond the most important part of bringing the engine out to public, we will always invest time and money into these tasks:

- **Community**. We will invest time not only coding but also building up a dev-friendly community

- **Documentation**. We will release API docs, guides and example code along the way to make it exxtremely easy for a Javascript developer to start his own E-Commerce project.
